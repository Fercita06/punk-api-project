Brewdog beers project

This is an app for Brewdog brewery built using React with data taken from Punk API at: https://punkapi.com/. 

User Interface
Users see 80 beer types taken from punk API on the screen, with the image, name, description, abv, ph, and brewed-year information for each beer type.

The search-box in the navigation bar can be used to dynamically search for any beer by its name. Clicking on the filters button on the top-right section takes the users to a list of filters, where one filter can be selected at a time to filter the beers displayed by specific conditions.
